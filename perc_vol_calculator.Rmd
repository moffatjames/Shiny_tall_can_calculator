## Alcohol Volume Calculator
I'll be trying to build a shiny app that documents the number of standard drinks in a tall can.
Ultimately I'll be planning to make a calculator that incorporates any products from the LCBO API,
So it should give a direct link up.

### basic formula for calulating tall can alcohol volume.


```{r}


perc_vol <- function(percent, volume) {
  std_drink <- .05 * 341
  num_drinks <- percent/100*volume/std_drink
  num_drinks
}

drink_table <- data.frame(percent = c(6, 7, 4, 6.5), volume = rep(500, 4))

drink_table$std_drinks <- perc_vol(drink_table$percent,drink_table$volume)


```
