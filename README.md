# Shiny_tall_can_calculator


I think that tall cans should have a standard drink equivalents listed. 

The plan for this project is to create a simple drink calculator first based on percentage alcohol content, with an adjustable volume setting, set either as a sliding scale or categorically.

in Phase 2 i would like to incorporate Ontario's LCBO API to add a drink lookup feature to be used for drinks. a scan option would even be possible for people in the lcbo.

This project will need to operate primarily in Javascript.
